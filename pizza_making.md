### A few experimentations with pizza making

_Note: all recipes, unless otherwise specified, are cooked on a 2,5cm thick pizza stone, in a normal, up to 220°, oven. A leaven like "lievito madre" is used_

Ingredients

* 400gr flour
* 240ml water
* 16gr sugar
* 9gr salt
* 5gr yeast
* 15ml olive oil

Instructions

In mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, yeast.

Melt salt in tiepid/warm water.

While mixing with flat paddle, slowly poor the water into dry mixture.

Let stand for 10 minutes+ (allows yeast to interact with water).

Hand knead until combined. Add olive oil. Roll into a ball.

Place in a covered bowl, in a warm place (22-23°C at least). Let it sit for up to 12 hours. Put in the fridge overnight, up to 24 hours.

A few hours before preparing the pizza, leave from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 2-6 hours. As long as it is still growing and the exterior isn't drying up.

An hour before preparing the pizza, put dough onto floured surface. Cut into two pieces. Pull the sides up and in until the bottom side resembles a dough ball. Flip over so that the clean looking side is on top and place onto floured cookie sheet. Lightly flour top, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for about an hour before flattening out and preparing pizza.
