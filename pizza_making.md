### A few experimentations with pizza making

_Note: all recipes, unless otherwise specified, are cooked on a 2,5cm thick pizza stone, in a normal, up to 220Â°, oven_

Ingredients

* 468gr flour
* 292ml water
* 16gr sugar
* 7gr salt
* 5gr yeast
* 15ml olive oil

Instructions

In mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, yeast.

While mixing with flat paddle, slowly poor ice water into dry mixture.

Let stand for 10 minutes+ (allows yeast to interact with water)

Add salt and olive oil. Hand knead until combined. Roll into a ball.

Place in oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 12-24 hours. If 24 hours, first 12 in the fridge.

An hour before preparing the pizza, put dough onto floured surface. Cut into two pieces. Pull the sides up and in until the bottom side resembles a dough ball. Flip over so that the clean looking side is on top and place onto floured cookie sheet. Lightly flour top, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for about an hour before flattening out and preparing pizza.
