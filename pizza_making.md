### A few experimentations with pizza making

_Note: all recipes, unless otherwise specified, are cooked on a 2,5cm thick pizza stone, in a normal, up to 220°, oven. A leaven like "lievito madre" is used_

Ingredients

* 290gr flour
* 170ml water
* 8gr sugar
* 10gr salt
* 100gr levain (or 15gr of yeast)
* 15ml olive oil

Instructions

In mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, levain (or yeast).

Melt salt in tiepid/warm water.

While mixing with flat paddle, slowly poor the water into dry mixture.

Let stand for 10 minutes+ (allows yeast to interact with water).

Hand knead until combined. Add olive oil. Roll into a ball.

Place in a covered bowl, in a warm place (22-23°C at least) for a couple of hours. 

After that, work the dough by stretching it, pulling it over the center, rotating 90° and stretching again. Do this until the stretching starts to lacerate the dough. Then stop.

Let it sit for 2 more hours. Repeat the stretching and pulling. Let it rest for about 30 minutes. Separate into multiple balls, if needed.

Then put in the fridge overnight, at least. Better yet for a whole 48 hours.

Before preparing the pizza, leave from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 2-6 hours. As long as it is still growing and the exterior isn't drying up. Then flat it out and prepare the pizza while the oven is warming up.
