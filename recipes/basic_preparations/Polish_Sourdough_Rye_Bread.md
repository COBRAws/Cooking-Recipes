The sourdough starter in this Polish rye bread recipe (loosely translated as chleb na zakwas żytni) gives it a delightful tang, but it takes two days to ripen, so plan accordingly. See the starter shortcut below.

Many people are familiar with white sourdough breads but don't realize some deli ryes are made with a sourdough, too.

Rye breads and wheat breads must be lightened with white flour otherwise, they would be too dense. Brushing with egg white before baking gives this bread a nice shine.

Shortcut: Instead of making a starter, substitute 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and reduce the water in the recipe from 2 1/2 cups to 3/4 cup.
