This is my personal recipe for a very strong, highly "lemony", Limoncello. I came up with this exact measuring of ingredients after quite a few tries over the years.

Ingredients
===========

* 8 Lemons (green! Ideally, 7 green and 1 yellow)
* 800ml water
* 700g sugar
* 1l pure alcohol (95% ABV)

Preparation
===========

Peel the lemons. Do not include any of the white, internal, part of the peel or the Limoncello will taste slightly sour. Just the external, green, peel

Submerge the peels in the alcohol in a transparent but covered glass pan.

Let them rest for at least 10 days, or until you can smell a strong, pungent, odour coming from them. Stir them once a day, gently.

When the odour is right, make a sugar syrup by boiling the water and the sugar. Let cool it, completely if you want your Limoncello to look clear or just tepid if the Limoncello has to look opaque. Your choice, it's only a cosmetical difference.

Filter the alcohol as to remove any physical remains of the peels. Pour it over the syrup, stirring.

Pour the Limoncello so created in a bottle and put it in a refrigerator for 20-30 days. The more the better but usually 20 days are enough to savour the full flavours of the drink.

Serve in cold glasses.
