In Polish families it is quite usual to serve kotlet schabowy with an even more 'soft' version of bigos, which is made without meat at all. This is actually quite similar recipe to that one above, but there's no bacon nor pork. I usually add stock cubes to improve the taste although it's against rules :P However, what I wanted to tell you is that such meatless food is most often called 'duszona kapusta' (simply means 'stewed cabbage'), not bigos. So we eat 'kotlet schabowy z duszona kapusta' (Polish pork schnitzel with stewed cabbage) very often - these two taste really great together (plus some boiled potatoes as usually). And what we call bigos, both a traditional one and bigos from a young cabbage, is a Polish food that contains meat by definition.

Ingredients

* 4 young cabbages
* 700gr lean pork
* 250gr smoked bacon
* 700gr thin sausages (kielbasa)
* 1 carrot

===========

Cut pork and onion into small pieces. Fry in oil.

Put fried meat & onion into a pot, add small amount of water and simmer for 30 minutes.

Cut cabbage into small pieces. To the boiling meat and onion add: cabbage, diced bacon, vegetables, whole bay leaves and allspice.

Boil the whole mixture until cabbage is soft.

Season your bigos with salt, pepper and a little sugar.

Before serving add sausages (kielbasa) to the pot to make them warm. Chop dill and sprinkle bigos served on plates (or serve chopped dill on a separate saucer).
