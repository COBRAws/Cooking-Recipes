Ingredients
===========

For the dough:

* 140ml warm milk
* 95ml warm water
* 6gr white sugar
* 100gr active dry yeast
* 2tsp olive oil
* 280gr all-purpose flour, divided
* 1.5tsp salt

For the filling:

* 200gr whole-milk mozzarella, shredded
* 200gr feta, crumbled
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 2tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature

Preparation
===========

Combine milk, water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Wait until the yeast starts to bubble. Approximately 5 to 15 minutes.

Add olive oil, flour and salt. Mix until the dough comes together.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for five minutes. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky, or simply add more flour to the surface and knead the flour in. Roll the dough into a ball shape.

Add olive oil to a large bowl and roll the dough ball in the oil to cover it. Cover the dough ball bowl with a towel and place in a warm part of the kitchen for approximately an hour to an hour and a half until the dough ball has doubled in size.

Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C)

Mix the cheeses together.

Crack the two eggs and keep each in a small cup or ramekin.

Remove the dough ball onto floured surface. Divide it in half and roll each half into a square shape.

Place rows of cheese along the long sides of the rectangular dough. Curl the dough over the cheese and roll it into a side crust. Roll the ends together and twist them twice. Then add the remaining cheese mixture into the boat shaped dough.

I was using a pizza peel and pizza steel to place the dough boats into the oven. At 260°C, they cooked in about 7 minutes. You could use a pizza stone, or a simple cookie sheet but each will affect your cooking times. You can also use parchment paper in place of the pizza peel to more easily transfer the dough boats into the oven.

The recipe I used suggested a 475°F ( 245°C ) oven, using a pizza stone and baking for 15 minutes.

Remove the Khachapuri from the oven, and using a spoon, push the cheese mixture to the sides, creating a well in the center. Pour the egg into the well and place the Khachapuri back into the oven for 4 minutes.

Remove the Khachapuri from the oven, and place it on a serving plate. Add half the butter to each Khachapuri.

To eat, stir up the cheese, butter and egg mixture to aid in cooking the egg. Tear off the bread boat ends and use them to scoop up the molten filling. Later, you can use a knife and fork to eat the remaining Khachapuri.
