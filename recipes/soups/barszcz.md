Ingredients
===========

For the Kwas
* 75g wholeleal rye flour
* 600ml boiled, cooled water
* 1/4 clove garlic

For the soup
* 2l of good beef or vegetable stock
* 1 onion peeled and chopped
* 1 bouquet garni
* 1 can mushrooms or 125g fresh halved
* 3 uncooked med beetroot, peeled and sliced thickly
* 300ml kwas
* 1tsp sugar

Preparation
===========

## Kwas

Rinse out an earthenware jar or any non-alluminium container with boiling water. (Note: the alluminium would react with the acidity of the kwas). Put the flour in the jar and mix to a liquid paste with a little of the water. Leave the mixture to settle for a few minutes and then pour on the remaining boiled water. Chop the garlic and add. Cover the jar with muslin or pierced clingfilm and leave in a warm place for 4 to 5 days to ferment. Strain and use as required. If stored in an airtight container, it will keep for a few weeks.

## Barszcz

Heat stock in a large pan. Add the onion, bouquet garni, mushrooms and beetroot. Boil for an hour

Strain the soup and stir the kwas into the clear soup. Add sugar to taste and reheat if necessary without boiling. Serve and enjoy.

You can add vegetables to the soup which is normally served during the Christmas Eve meatless dinner. Vegetables used are celery, carrot and parsnip, which are roughly chopped.
