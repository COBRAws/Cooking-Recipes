# Cooking Recipes 

A curated list of cooking recipes. Mostly in italian, a few in english. All in metric (no friggin' cups and ounces...). 

All have been collected over the years from the Net, relatives, mum and personal experimentation. Credit is given when remembered (and if you see a recipe of yours and want it credited/removed do contact me and I'll act as soon as I can).

Feel free to PRs for new recipes as long as they're tested by yourself (no blind copying from the internet). Sometimes a recipe looks great on paper but it's not so when done. If you have regional/local recipes that your grandma used to do, all the better.

Do pull requests for translating the recipes too. I admit not having the time these days to make them all in english so feel free to do it. Other languages are also welcome.
